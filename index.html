        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Dear Readers,
            Sunitidevi singhania school is born out of a dream to start a school in Thane so that more children would get access to good education. It is our Endeavour at Sunitidevi Singhania school to have open classrooms and innovative learning spaces where children learn deeply and joyously. Children learn best when they have something to do. Something that demands thinking engages them actively. At School, we drive hands on experiences and digital tools with the same passion, to enable our children to be able to ready themselves for life.

            Education to me is about Wings to fly high , with roots that keeps an individual grounded with values. The purpose of education is dual - to be a good human being and to equip ourselves with right knowledge, skills and competencies that we need to be prepared for life ahead. The disruptions that we have seen in 2020 has made us realise the need to adopt and adapt to change. And we have to build that power in each of our students.

            We are a young school, but we have the support of our other Singhania Schools that guide the Sunitians. Schools do not function in isolation any more. It is a collaborative space that we function in. The foundation of the school depends upon the synergy and support given by Management, parents, teachers and students. Together, we will make a great school that "offers equal opportunities to all do that they rise to their fullest potential"</p>
        <p>With warm Regards,</p>
        <p>Mrs. Revathi Srinivasan,</p>
        <p>Director, Education, Singhania Schools</p>
